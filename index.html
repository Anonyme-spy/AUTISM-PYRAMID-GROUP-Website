            <p>We are a voluntary, parent led group who formed in 2012 because there were no local support groups in
                operation.
                We are all parents of a child/children on the spectrum.</p>
            <p>We support the whole family, not just the child or young person with the diagnosis,
                and we welcome siblings and extended family members to participate in events and celebrations</p>
            <p>Support is available both online and in person but although we have lots of experience amongst members we
                are not professionals and will always signpost members to the relevant and most appropriate source for
                help.</p>

            <h4>Online support is available via 2 Facebook sites</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/125986947526284/">Members only</a> – before you are
                    accepted into this group you will need to answer a few questions. This
                    group is private and confidential and includes some professionals as well as parents/carers</li>
                <li><a href=#>Community</a> – this page if totally open to the public and can be used by anyone in the
                    wider community either to advertise services of interest or just to support autism
                    families.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Face to face support currently consists of a monthly Stay and Play Session, a Coffee Morning for parents
                only and (when funds allow it) Trips or activities at either a discounted rate or sometimes totally
                funded </p>
