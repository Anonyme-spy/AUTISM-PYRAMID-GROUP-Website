                <p id="heroText2">We support the whole family, not just the child or young person with the diagnosis, and we welcome siblings and extended family members to participate in events and celebrations</p>
                <p id="heroText3">Support is available both online and in person but although we have lots of experience amongst members we are not professionals and will always signpost members to the relevant and most appropriate source for help.</p>
